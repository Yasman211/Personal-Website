    <h3>Hi,</h3>

    <section>
        My name is Yasir Bello, I am a driven and curious individual. Over the past few weeks i wafascinated by how technology can transform ideas
        into reality. From a young age, I found myself captivated by computers—not just as tools, but as gateways to
        solving real problems, creating solutions, and building things that didn’t exist before. While most people see
        programming as lines of code, I see it as a language of possibility—a way to take imagination and turn it into
        something tangible that can impact the world.

        My interest in computer programming is rooted in a bigger goal: I want to create solutions that make life
        easier, more efficient, and more accessible for everyone. I’ve always been drawn to challenges, and programming
        allows me to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. It teaches me patience, logical
        thinking, and creativity all at once. Every project, every line of code, and every problem I solve brings me
        closer to understanding how technology can be harnessed to achieve bigger visions.
